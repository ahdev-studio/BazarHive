    <h1>Privacy Policy for BazarHive</h1>
    <p>Last updated: June 25, 2024</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how BazarHive collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> This includes the content you create, such as shopping lists, item names, categories, and inventory data. This data is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Google User Information:</strong> If you choose to use the Google Drive backup feature, we authenticate you using your Google account. We do not store your password. We only receive basic profile information for authentication purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the app's functionality.</li>
        <li>Enable you to back up and restore your shopping lists and inventory data to your personal Google Drive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google Drive API Usage</h2>
    <p>BazarHive uses the Google Drive API with the restricted <strong>`drive.file`</strong> scope. This means our app can only access files that it has created itself. These files are stored in a dedicated application folder named 'BazarHive' in your Google Drive. Our app <strong>cannot</strong> see, access, modify, or delete any other files or folders in your Google Drive.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal data with any third-party companies or services, except as necessary to provide the app's features (e.g., with Google for authentication and backup to your own Drive).</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your data. All your shopping list data is stored locally on your device. When you use the backup feature, your data is transferred securely to your personal Google Drive account, protected by Google's security infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
